            <ol type="i">
                <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
                <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Socspy's application;</li>
                <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
            </ol>
