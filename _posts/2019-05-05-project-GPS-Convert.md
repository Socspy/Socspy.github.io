This app is all about GPS coordinates conversion. 

Find the location in maps with special coordinates system (WGS84, VN2000 ...)
You can also save the location to work late.

While saving a place, modify one end of the data (either the geographic or map grid coordinates), the other end is simultaneously updated, as well as the position on the map.

You can also start to convert latitude and longitude by tapping on the map, which will pre-fill the fields with the GPS coordinates of the location you tapped on.
